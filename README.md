# NNGP-VSG
We chose a battery dataset with 64-dimensional features with a data volume of 200.NNGP-VSG is a non-stationary kernel-based virtual sample generation algorithm for the Gaussian process. 
The dataset was collected from the Automatic Flow for Materials Discovery(AFLOW) Database. The dataset contains 200 materials and  63 electronic,  physical,  chemical,  and crystal properties are used to predict the target property-Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) .
